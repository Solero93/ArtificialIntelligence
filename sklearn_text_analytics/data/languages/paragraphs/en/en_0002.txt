Supporters of Wikipedia cite a 2005 survey of Wikipedia published in Nature based on a comparison of 42 science articles with Encyclopedia Britannica, which found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached Encyclopedia Britannica‍ '​s.[16] Criticisms of Wikipedia include claims that it exhibits systemic bias, presents a mixture of "truths, half truths, and some falsehoods",[17] and is subject to manipulation and spin.[18]
